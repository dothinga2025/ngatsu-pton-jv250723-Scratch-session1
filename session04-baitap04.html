            <b>A website</b>(also written as a<b> web site</b>) is one or more <span class="text-blue">web pages</span>
            and related content that is identified by a common<span class="text-blue"></span> domain name </span>and
            published on at least one <span class="text-blue"> web server</span>. Websites are typically dedicated to a
            particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social media.<span
                class="text-blue"> Hyperlinking </span>between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often
            starts with a <span class="text-blue"> home page</span>. The <span class="text-blue">most-visited </span>
            sites are <span style="text-blue">Google, YouTube,</span> and
            <span class="text-blue">Facebook.</span><br><br>
        
            All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span class="text-blue">World Wide Web</span>.
            There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a<span class="text-blue"> private
                network</span>, such as a company's internal website for its employees. <span
                class="text-blue">Users</span>can access websites on a range of devices, including
            <span class="text-blue">desktops, laptops, tablets</span>, and<span style="text-blue">smartphones</span> .
            The<span class="text-blue"> app </span>used on these devices is called a <span class="text-blue">web brower.</span>
